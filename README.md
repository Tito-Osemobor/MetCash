![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tito-Osemobor/MetCash/assets/metcash-image.png)

A Java-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) ATM system with a strong focus on providing users with a secure and user-friendly platform for conducting transactions.
## Overview

The ATM Project is designed to mimic the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). It provides features such as user authentication, account balance inquiries, cash withdrawals, fund transfers, and more. The project utilizes Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI) and follows object-oriented principles for modular and extensible code.

## Features

- User authentication: Users can log in to the ATM system using their card credentials.
- Account balance inquiries: Users can check their account balances for both checking and savings accounts.
- Cash withdrawals: Users can withdraw cash from their accounts, reducing the account balance accordingly.
- Fund transfers: Users can transfer funds between their own accounts (checking to savings and vice versa).
- Transaction history: The system keeps track of user transactions for future reference.

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- An integrated development environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse (optional)
